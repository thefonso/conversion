#Notes:

How I spent my time and What I could do better:

Mon: spent time looking up fonts and icons for image

Tue: could not find icon library so began process of meticulously cutting out images, making them transparent png where possible and then converting them into svg. Used thegimp and Figma for this process. Per original requirements I had to convert 1 for 1 for the design

Wed: Had to split time bettween external duties (read day job and freelance work ^_^) and app but began process of building up code into html and css

Thurday / Friday: Split code into components and do final touches before hand in 

What I think I could do better:

A few details here and there on the visual conversion, converting px to rem or somthing better. Refactoring the css and transfering it to sass.

tested only in firefox, requirements didn't call on responsive so I just focused on getting the look as close as I can in time.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Side note: 

I used yarn on my local machine to get things going. But I think the normal npm way should do fine.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
